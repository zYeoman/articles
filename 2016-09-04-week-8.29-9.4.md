实习告一段落, 其实还是有点怀念的.

人生第一次写出超过一万字的东西竟然是实习报告...

开始安心准备推研了, 然而拖延症还不知道要什么时候才会真正开始复习...

最近看到[这里][1]上吐槽的各种开发方式, 比如混蛋驱动开发(Asshole driven development)等
等, 真是中箭颇多....尤其是评论里的那个google驱动的开发,


Here is how to identify a GDD guy

* This person does not believe in writing anything on his own, copy/paste from blogs, articles, source code is a way of life. And since I have not written it I don't care how it works as long as I see something working. His best friends are Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V and Google.
* Cannot write 5 lines of code or code for 5 minutes without doing a Google search.
* His productivity is directly related to performance of corporate network, and how fast Google searches. If the network is down, it's better to go for a coffee.
* Search hours on Google for "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" and then believes that the whole world is facing the same issue. Who cares what the context of problem is.
* To solve the error
    * He then tries each and every solution that Google GOD provides.
    * If by fluke he is able to fix or camouflage the issue, he considers himself something special, but in his heart he knows he has no clue what happened. Thanks Google for saving his day and continues his pursuit to become a better GDDer.
    * If not, then it's time for the Lead, the next GOD in Line. The Lead should be able to fix this issue, What else are Leads there for :)
* Reading documentation is so very lame ! Documentation is for sissies,  real developers do Google.
* Religiously believes that all results returned by Google are correct. Google has employed a huge workforce just to make sure results are correct.
